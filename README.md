Conceptual Services - screenshots and brief notes
================

Browse screenshots of conceptual services, for land and property services

You can view different sets of screenshots for each exemplar, zoom in and out of them or step through them in order.


## Running this app locally

The app is very simple and doesn't require anything to be installed or run in a terminal. Just open the index.html file in the root folder. It works especially well in Chrome's presentation mode. Your mileage may vary in other browsers.

## examples to conceptualise and add here include:

- CCA
- commonhold
- find information about property - citizen
- services for information - organised around group/need
- services a citizen dould do themselves, like afer a death of a change of name, and any other ideas?
- permission to do something, that needs information about property - an owner or someone with a right getting permission, or giving another person access
- geospatial ideas - what could a geostpatial register do / allow?
- digital casework - if public services changed how would casework change to also suppoert that / work in the future

this is a lightweight app, to show the main idea or ideas, if you have another prototype with more information, link to that.


## How to contribute

If you work on conceptualising what could be a truly digital vision - without current constraints.  I.e. what would a service be like now, if starting from sratch.


### 1. Add your images

Each conceptaul service has it's own numbered folder in '/exemplar'. Drop all your images into the 'images' subfolder (1024px wide is best).

### 2. Update the data file

Edit the data.js file in your numbered exemplar folder. It contains a few examples so you can see how the data should be structured.

### 3. Update the index file

Once you're done, don't forget to add a link to your exemplar from the 'index.html' file in the root of this repository (not the one in your numbered exemplar folder).
